## **Prerequisites**

Before starting the assignment, ensure you have the following software installed and properly configured on your machine:

1. **Python 3.x**:
   - [Download and Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

2. **PySpark**:
   - Install using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pyspark
     ```

3. **Apache Spark**:
   - Ensure Spark is installed. You can download it from the [Apache Spark Downloads](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) page.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Project Structure**

Ensure your project directory follows the structure below:

```
MovieRatingsAnalysis/
├── input/
│   └── movie_ratings_data.csv
├── outputs/
│   ├── binge_watching_patterns.csv
│   ├──churn_risk_users.csv
│   └── movie_watching_trends.csv
├── src/
│   ├── task1_binge_watching_patterns.py
│   ├── task2_churn_risk_users.py
│   └── task3_movie_watching_trends.py
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```



- **input/**: Contains the `movie_ratings_data.csv` dataset.
- **outputs/**: Directory where the results of each task will be saved.
- **src/**: Contains the individual Python scripts for each task.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration file to set up Spark.
- **README.md**: Assignment instructions and guidelines.

### **2. Running the Analysis Tasks**

You can run the analysis tasks either locally or using Docker.

#### **a. Running Locally**

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MovieRatingsAnalysis/
   ```

2. **Execute Each Task Using `spark-submit`**:
   ```bash
   spark-submit src/task1_binge_watching_patterns.py
   spark-submit src/task2_churn_risk_users.py
   spark-submit src/task3_movie_watching_trends.py
   ```

3. **Verify the Outputs**:
   Check the `outputs/` directory for the resulting files:
   ```bash
   ls outputs/
   ```
   You should see:
   - `binge_watching_patterns.txt`
   - `churn_risk_users.csv`
   - `movie_watching_trends.csv`


5. **Exit the Container**:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

6. **Verify the Outputs**:
   On your host machine, check the `outputs/` directory for the resulting files.

7. **Stop the Spark Cluster**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## **Overview**

In this assignment, we has leverage Spark Structured APIs to analyze a dataset containing employee information from various departments within an organization. we have extracted meaningful insights related to employee satisfaction, engagement, concerns, and job titles. This exercise is designed to enhanced data manipulation and analytical skills using Spark's powerful APIs.

## **Objectives**

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Import and preprocess data using Spark Structured APIs.
2. **Data Analysis**: Perform complex queries and transformations to address specific business questions.
3. **Insight Generation**: Derive actionable insights from the analyzed data.

## **Dataset**

## **Dataset: Advanced Movie Ratings & Streaming Trends**

You will work with a dataset containing information about **100+ users** who rated movies across various streaming platforms. The dataset includes the following columns:

| **Column Name**         | **Data Type**  | **Description** |

Determine which movies have an average watch time greater than 100 minutes and rank them based on user engagement.

**Tasks:**

- **Filter Movies**: Select movies that have been watched for more than 100 minutes on average.
- **Analyze Average Watch Time**: Compute the average watch time per user for each movie.
- **Identify Top Movies**: List movies where the average watch time is among the highest.


**Outcome:**

A list of departments meeting the specified criteria, along with the corresponding percentages.

**Output:**

| Age Group   | Binge Watchers | Total Users  |Percentage |

### **2. Identify Churn Risk Users**  

**Objective:**  

Find users who are **at risk of churn** by identifying those with **canceled subscriptions and low watch time (<100 minutes)**.

**Tasks:**  

- **Filter Users**: Select users who have `SubscriptionStatus = 'Canceled'`.  
- **Analyze Watch Time**: Identify users with `WatchTime < 100` minutes.  
- **Count At-Risk Users**: Compute the total number of such users.  

**Outcome:**  

A count of users who **canceled their subscriptions and had low engagement**, highlighting **potential churn risks**.

**Output:**  


|Churn Risk Users                                  |	Total Users |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|Users with low watch time & canceled subscriptions|	13          |

Findings:
- A significant percentage of users with low watch time tend to cancel subscriptions.
- Identifying these users can help with targeted retention strategies.
